# iSentryGenomicsPipeline


The iSENTRY project seeks to develop a universal platform for the high throughput, phenotype-based identification of bacterial pathogens in complex environments like soil or water. It is a joint project that involves five different institutions (Texas A&M University, University of California San Francisco, University of Oklahoma, University of Virginia and Argonne National Laboratory). Our approach integrates innovations in environmental microbiology, high-throughput droplet microfluidics, DNA barcoding, single-cell droplet sequencing, and machine learning/computational biology, representing a revolutionary advance in the science, devices, and systems needed for the isolation and characterization of known and potentially unknown or unculturable bacterial pathogens.
